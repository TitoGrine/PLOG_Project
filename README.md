#### To Do:
 - [x] Have the game alternate turns between the players
 - [x] Recenter board when pieces are on the edge
 - [x] Check for virtual limits (horizontal & vertical)
 - [x] Check for valid placement
 - [x] Check for valid movement of all pieces
 - [x] Check if queen is surrounded and remove it from the game (no longer playable)
 - [x] Check if king is surrounded and end the game with victory message
 - [ ] When a pawn is placed, allow the player to move it after (in the same turn)
 - [ ] When a bishop is placed, make(or allow?) the player to remove a piece from the board (in the same turn) *imp. use delete_from_database*
 - [ ] When a player is asked to choose a piece, have the possibility of choosing 'swap' in order to swap their rook with the king (if possible)
 - [ ] Make the main menu to choose game mode
 - [ ] Implement game mode with random AI
 - [ ] Implement game mode with smart AI at least one level of decision)

 - [ ] Try to remove as many warnings as possible

#### Testing:
 - [ ] Placement on board
